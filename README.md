# Machine Learning Track

## Design Document

### Overview
The goal of this project is to design a machine learning model for real estate price prediction. The implementation consists of the following:

- A web crawler for obtaining features from Zillow or Redfin
- Data cleaning followed by persisting crawled data to database
- Machine learning model training with cross-validation
- Future price prediction and offline monitoring system
- Visualization

### Use cases
For those who intend to buy a property in the given area can utilize the price prediction and trend as references to help them making the choices.
Send reminder to customers when the properties met the criteria are on market

### Time line
- Week 1: collect all information required for machine learning analysis and store into database
- Week 2: machine learning model training and evaluation
- Week 3: Visualization and set up reminders
